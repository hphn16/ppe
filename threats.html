        <h2>Understanding Threats in Healthcare Information Security</h2>
        <h5>What are threats?</h5>
        <p><b>Threats</b> in healthcare can be categorized as cyberattacks, data breaches, and insider threats. There are many different forms of threats, with the most common ones being ransomware/malware and phishing scams.</p>
        <p>When a machine or device is infected by <b>ransomware</b>, the files are encrypted, access is denied and a ransom is demanded. The data involved is basically being held hostage until the demands of the cyberattacker are met. Complying with the cyberattacker does not guarantee they restore access to the data.</p>
        <p><b>Malware</b> is when a machine or device is infected with virus, trojans, worms, or keyloggers. They are created to steal credentials such as usernames, passwords, and other tokens. Wipers can be installed which the entire data storage medium may be erased. In an event like this, backups should be made regularly.
            <p><b>Phishing</b> scams are a social engineering scam that targets the end user with familiar images and content. Users are fooled into disclosing sensitive information, clicking on malicious link, or opening malicious attachments. <br>Phishing emails are the most common form of phishing, they also come in forms of websites, social media, SMS messages, and voice calls.</p>
