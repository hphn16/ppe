        <h5>What is Information Security?</h5>
        <img src="images/securitybanner.jpg" class="responsive" width="895px">
        <p>To understand information security in healthcare, we have to first understand what information security is.<br>
        <b>Information security</b> refers to the processes and tools designed and deployed to protect sensitive business information from modification, disruption, destruction, and inspection. While information security protects all forms of information, <b>cybersecurity</b>, a subset of information security, protects all forms of digital information including computers, handheld devices, cloud, and networks. <br><br>In healthcare, information security is achieved by ensuring the <b>confidentiality</b>, <b>integrity</b>, and <b>availability</b> of information. As a growing trend for digitalization, there is also a growing amount of threats that can target health information.

As clinics and hospitals using paper medical records start adopting new electronic health record systems, it is important to identify the risks and practice the proper procedure in protecting electronic health information.
          <br><br>
          Implementations of EHR or electronic health record, it introduces risks to health information. An <b>EHR</b> is an eletronic record of health related information of an individual that conforms to nationally recognized interoperability standards and that can be created, managed, and consulted by authorized clinicians and staff across more than one health care organization.
          <br><br><b>Safeguards</b> are solutions and tools used to implement security policies. It can be <b>administrative</b>, <b>physical</b>, or <b>technical</b>. Below are some examples of each safeguard.<br>
